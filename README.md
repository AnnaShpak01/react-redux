Created a simple react app using React Web + Redux. The app should display the latest Hacker News articles. There should be an input field that filters the displayed articles. The input should accept a specific string of accepted characters only (see below). There should be a submit button that tells you if the text was accepted in a message of some sort; you should not be able to click the button more than once unless the text input is invalid and then modified. Style is not the primary focus usability and functionality are (but overall look and feel still matters).  Requirements for input: Alphanumeric, dash, period, and underscore input only. Input must start and end with an alphanumeric character. You may not have any non-alphanumeric characters twice in a row, such as a dash and a period side by side. The string must be at least 3 characters long and no more than 50 characters.  There should be a submit button that tells you if the text was accepted in a message of some sort; you should not be able to click the button more than once unless the text input is invalid and then modified.
